//DONE
[x] - basic text editing
[x] - scrolling text edit area
[x] - code syntax highlighting
[x] - directory/file listing and listing UI
[x] - goto line command
[x] - loading, saving files

//TODO
[] - smooth scrolling
[] - copy paste texts(clipboard)
[] - directory/file list UI scrolling
[] - undo redo system
[] - vertical and horizontal split editing spaces.
[] - editor commmads and UI command list menu
[] - config file parsing
[] - theme file parsing
[] - handle text buffer memory allocation(avoid use of malloc and realloc)

//alternative implementation(never going to happen)
[] - text buffer as split buffer(modified version of gap buffer), currently array of Gap buffers
[] - text buffer as piece table(good redo undo system)
